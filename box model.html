Pizza, as we know it today, originated in Naples, Italy. While flatbreads with toppings have existed in various forms throughout history, modern pizza, with its tomato sauce and toppings, is believed to have developed in Naples between the 16th and 18th centuries. Initially, it was a dish for the poor, sold by street vendors. A famous legend attributes the creation of the Margherita pizza, with tomato, mozzarella, and basil, to the baker Raffaele Esposito in 1889, in honor of Queen Margherita.
