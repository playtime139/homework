                Cats are fascinating creatures with a wide range of unique traits. They are known for their incredible agility, capable of jumping up to six times their height. Cats are also very flexible, allowing them to squeeze into tight spaces. A cat's nose print is as unique as a human fingerprint. Furthermore, cats are unable to taste sweetness, according to several sources. They also have a third eyelid, called a nictitating membrane, which helps protect and moisturize their eyes.
